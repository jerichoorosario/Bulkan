    "volcano_info": "The 2158-m-high Banahaw (also known as Banahao) is the highest of a group of volcanoes south and east of Manila.  Banahaw is flanked by San Cristobal volcano on the west and Banahaw de Lucban on the NE.  Andesitic-to-dacitic lava domes occur on the flanks of Banahaw and San Cristobal.  Two major Holocene debris avalanches have occurred at Banahaw volcano.  The deposit from one extends 13 km to the NE and the other 26 km to the SE, where it forms 10 km of the coastline of Tayabas Bay.  San Cristobal stratovolcano rises to 1480 m, 7 km west of Banahaw.  Its youthful morphology suggests that it postdates Banahaw.  Banahaw de Lucban is a 1875-m-high stratovolcano that was constructed within the 8-km-wide, horseshoe-shaped caldera related to the two debris avalanches, and is the youngest volcano of the Banahaw complex.  The 2-km-wide, 600-m-deep summit crater of Banahaw is open to the SSW and contained a crater lake until 1730, when it drained, forming mudflows.  Mudflows were also recorded in 1743?, 1843 and 1909, possibly also associated with explosive activity.     ",

    "volcano_info": "The San Pablo volcanic field, (also known as the Laguna volcanic field) lies at the southern end of Laguna de Bay, the largest lake on Luzon Island. The field contains dozens of scoria cones and maars. Three generations of maars are present, with the oldest being sediment-filled and the youngest containing deep lakes. Many of the maars are aligned along a NE-SW trend. Local legends suggest that the youngest maar, 1.2-km-wide Sampaloc Lake, was formed about 500-700 years ago. The high point of the volcanic field is the eroded Maquiling (Makiling) andesitic-to-rhyolitic stratovolcano, which has a deep crater whose floor is 480 m below its north rim. Maquiling has several parasitic cones, maars, and numerous thermal areas at its northern base. A geothermal project is located on the south flank of Maquiling.",

Though not topographically prominent, its prehistorical eruptions have greatly changed the topography of SW Luzon. The 15 x 20 km Talisay (Taal) caldera is largely filled by Lake Taal, whose 267 km2 surface lies only 3 m above sea level. The maximum depth of the lake is 160 m, and several eruptive centers lie submerged beneath the lake. The 5-km-wide Volcano Island in north-central Lake Taal is the location of all historical eruptions. The island is composed of coalescing small stratovolcanoes, tuff rings, and scoria cones that has grown about 25% in area during historical time. Powerful pyroclastic flows and surges from historical eruptions have caused many fatalities.",

    "volcano_info": "Prior to 1991 Pinatubo volcano was a relatively unknown, heavily forested lava dome complex located 100 km NW of Manila with no records of historical eruptions. The 1991 eruption, one of the world's largest of the 20th century, ejected massive amounts of tephra and produced voluminous pyroclastic flows, forming a small, 2.5-km-wide summit caldera whose floor is now covered by a lake. Caldera formation lowered the height of the summit by more than 300 m. Although the eruption caused hundreds of fatalities and major damage with severe social and economic impact, successful monitoring efforts greatly reduced the number of fatalities.  Widespread lahars that redistributed products of the 1991 eruption have continued to cause severe disruption. Previous major eruptive periods, interrupted by lengthy quiescent periods, have produced pyroclastic flows and lahars that were even more extensive than in 1991.",

Pre-caldera Pleistocene volcanism formed basaltic to basaltic-andesitic volcanoes, including Talim Island and Mount Sembrano stratovolcanoes on opposite sides of the current caldera.  The caldera, whose lake surface is only 1 m above sea level, may have formed during at least two major explosive eruptions about 1 million and 27,000-29,000 years ago.  Post-caldera volcanism formed maars of young, but unknown age at the southern end of elongated Talim Island, which forms the SW rim of the caldera.  Jalajala is a solfataric field on the flank of Mount Sembrano on the Jalajala Peninsula, which forms the eastern rim of the caldera.",

Ambalatungan volcano proper contains a steep-walled crater with hot springs and vigorous sulfur-encrusted fumarolic vents that produce loud noises.  Bumabag volcano, 3 km east of Ambalatungan, has two craters that also show strong fumarolic activity.  Podakan volcano, 1 km SE of Bumabag, also has a large steam vent.  A possible steam eruption was reported from 2329-m-high Mount Binuluan (whose relationship to the previously mentioned volcanoes is unclear) in 1952, during which a sulfur-rich debris flow killed a dozen people.",
